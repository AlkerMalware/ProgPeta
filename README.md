the game is number based for controls or choices like picking an item, so basically your controls are [1][2][3][4][5][6]
the only letter based controls are only y|n for continuation or ending the game.

i have not encounter any bugs so far within the game, so as so far as i know theirs none.

the concept i gone with is a dark soul story theme, bossrushed game, but of course text based with the only enemies are boss

i was limited by skills and time when i was trying to add other things into the game like, dialogue, multiple endings, switching weapons when defeating a boss depending on the class, and other useful items besides the healing flask(anti-greifa flask).
